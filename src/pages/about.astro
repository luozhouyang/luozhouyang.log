    Hi there! I'm a software engineer passionate about building things for the
    web. I specialize in full-stack development with a focus on modern web
    technologies and cloud architecture.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey in tech started several years ago when I first discovered my love
    for programming. Since then, I've worked on various projects ranging from
    web applications to distributed systems. I'm particularly interested in
    performance optimization, system design, and creating intuitive user
    experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open source projects,
    writing technical blog posts, or learning about new technologies. I believe
    in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have experience working with various technologies including: •
    JavaScript/TypeScript • React/Vue.js • Node.js • Python • Cloud platforms
    (AWS, GCP) • Docker and Kubernetes
  </p>

  <p>
    Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on projects or just chat
    about technology. You can find me on GitHub, Twitter, or send me an email
    through the contact form.
  </p>
